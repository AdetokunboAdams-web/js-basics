We call a language “statically-typed” if it follows type checking during compilation. So, every detail about the variables and all the data types must be known before we do the compiling process.
In this type of language, once a variable is assigned a type, it can’t be assigned to some other variable of a different type. If we try to do so, the compiler will raise some errors, and we need to fix them. Hence, for a declared variable, the data type is fixed.Some examples of statically-typed languages are Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust, Go, COBOL, etc.

We call a language “dynamically typed” if type checking takes place while the program runs (run-time). In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code.
It means that you can write pretty quickly since you do not have to specify types every time. Some languages do allow you to provide type information but do not require it.
Most modern programming languages are dynamically typed. Some examples of dynamically-typed languages are Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, etc.

If a variable is declared but not assigned to a value, the value of the variable will be undefined while null is a special value that represent an empty or unknown value.
